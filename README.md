# Garbage Classification using Transfer Learning

This project classifies garbage images into different categories using
Transfer Learning with the EfficientNet model. It helps in automated
waste segregation and recycling systems.

## Features
- Image-based garbage classification
- Uses pre-trained EfficientNet
- Gradio-based web interface
- Real-time predictions

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Gradio
- NumPy
- Pillow

## How to Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
